This repo maintains various commands, recipes, snippets, [links](https://github.com/ravisharda/pravega-developer-resources/blob/master/useful-links.md) and scripts that make my life as a Pravega developer a tad easier. The names of the files are (hopefully) self-explanatory.

New files are added here occasionally. Existing ones - especially the ones that were added recently - tend to be updated frequently. 

These files are far from being comprehensive. They only contain stuff that I've needed while working on Pravega and things I might easily forget. Also, you might find stuff not needed while working on Pravega - I have them here for my quick reference.

To contribute, feel free to create an issue and raise a pull request. :) Or, reach out to me.
